# Data-Mining-Project-- Mushroom-Ediblility-Prediction

Mushrooms are fungi, part of a kingdom of their own separate from plants and animals. As you might imagine, they present numerous features to assess before deciding whether one is edible or not.

### Information about the dataset:

This dataset includes 61069 hypothetical mushrooms with caps based on 173 species (353 mushrooms per species). Each mushroom is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous,



### Feature Information:
cap-diameter (m): float number in cm
cap-shape (n): bell=b, conical=c, convex=x, flat=f,
sunken=s, spherical=p, others=o
cap-surface (n): fibrous=i, grooves=g, scaly=y, smooth=s,
shiny=h, leathery=l, silky=k, sticky=t,
wrinkled=w, fleshy=e
cap-color (n): brown=n, buff=b, gray=g, green=r, pink=p,
purple=u, red=e, white=w, yellow=y, blue=l,
orange=o, black=k
does-bruise-bleed (n): bruises-or-bleeding=t,no=f
gill-attachment (n): adnate=a, adnexed=x, decurrent=d, free=e,
sinuate=s, pores=p, none=f, unknown=?
gill-spacing (n): close=c, distant=d, none=f
gill-color (n): see cap-color + none=f
stem-height (m): float number in cm
